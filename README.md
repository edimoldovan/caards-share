Hapi example

* controllers
* jw auth

`npm install` in the `api` folder, then `node app.js`.
I tried it with latest node v4.1, but should work backwords to v10.12.7 too.

http://0.0.0.0:8000/api/documentation#!/api/apisessions_post_2 by
clicking on the right side on the Model Schema, then in the yellow box
that is revealed, then filling in some bogus username and and password
in the textbox on the left, in the json string.
